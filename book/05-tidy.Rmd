# Data Tidying {#tidy}

## Intended Learning Outcomes {#ilo-tidy}

* Be able to change data between long and wide formats
* Separate, mutate, reorder, and rename columns
* Use pipes to chain together functions

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse) # functions from tidyr, dplyr, readr, and pipes
library(readxl)
library(stringr)
```

You'll learn about the following functions in this chapter:

* `tidyr::pivot_longer()'
* `tidyr::pivot_wider()`
* `tidyr::separate()`
* `dplyr::select()`
* `dplyr::mutate()`
* `readr::type_convert()`
* `stringr::str_replace_all()`
* `tidyr::starts_with()`
* `%>%`



## Data Structure

An `r glossary("observation")` is all the information about a single "thing" at a single point in time. These things can be customers, sales, orders, feedback questionnaires, tweets, or really anything. Observations should have a way to identify them, such as a unique ID or combination of variable values.

A `r glossary("variable")` is one type of information about the observation. For example, if the observation is a sale, the variables you might have about the sale are the sale ID, the customer's ID, the date of the sale, the price paid, and method of payment. 

A `r glossary("value")` is the data for one variable for one observation. For example, the value of the date variable from the observation of a sale might be `2021-08-20`.

There are three rules for "tidy data", which is data in a format that makes it easier to combine data from different tables, create summary tables, and visualise your data.

* Each observation must have its own row
* Each variable must have its own column
* Each value must have its own cell


```{r, include=FALSE}
set.seed(90210)

tidy_data <- crossing(
  customer_id = 1:5,
  year = 2018:2020
) %>%
  mutate(items = sample(0:10, nrow(.), T)) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(price_per_item = round(rnorm(1, 5, 2), 2)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(totalprice = items * price_per_item)

untidy_data <- tidy_data %>%
  mutate(itemsprice = glue::glue("{items} ({price_per_item})")) %>%
  select(-items, -price_per_item) %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = customer_id,
              names_from = year,
              values_from = c(itemsprice, totalprice)
              )

write_csv(tidy_data, "data/tidy_data.csv")
write_csv(untidy_data, "data/untidy_data.csv")

```


### Untidy data

The table below has three observations per row (one customer's orders from 2018, 2019, and 2020) and the `itemsprice_{year}` columns contain two values (number of items and price per item). 

`r kable(untidy_data, caption = "Untidy table")`

Let's say you wanted to calculate the total price per customer over the three years and the total number of items bought per customer. You can't perform mathematical operations on the `itemsprice_{year}` columns because they are `r glossary("character")` `r glossary("data type", "data types")`.

You would probably normally use Excel to 

1. split `itemsprice_2018` columns into `item_2018` and `price_2018` columns
2. split `itemsprice_2019` columns into `item_2019` and `price_2019` columns
3. split `itemsprice_2020` columns into `item_2018` and `price_2020` columns
4. add item_2018 + item_2019 + item_2020 to get the total number of items bought per customer
5. add totalprice_2018 + totalprice_2019 + totalprice_2020 to get the total price per customer

::: {.try data-latex=""}
Think about how many steps in Excel this would be if there were 10 years in the table, or a different number of years each time you encountered data like this.
:::

### Tidy data

This is the tidy version, where each row is a customer's orders in a particular year. The number of items (`items`) and price per item (`price_per_item`) are in separate columns, so now you can perform mathematical operations on them.

`r kable(tidy_data, caption = "Tidy table")`

To calculate the total price per customer over the three years and the total number of items bought per customer in R, you would need to:

1. group the table by customer_id
2. sum the `items` column to get the total number of items bought per customer
3. sum the `totalprice` column to get the total price per customer

```{r, message=FALSE}
tidy_data <- read_csv("data/tidy_data.csv")

# we'll learn about these functions later
tidy_data %>%
  group_by(customer_id) %>%
  summarise(
    total_items = sum(items),
    total_price = sum(totalprice)
  )
```

::: {.info data-latex=""}
If there were 10 years in the table, or a different number of years each time you encountered data like this, the code for producing the table above never changes.
:::

If you have control over how the data are recorded, it will make your life easier to record it in a tidy format from the start. However, we don't always have control, so this class will also teach you how to convert an untidy table into a tidy tables.

## Reshaping Data

Data tables can be in `r glossary("wide")` format or `r glossary("long")` format (or a mix of the two). Wide data are where all of the observations about one thing are in the same row, while long data are where each observation is on a separate row. You often need to convert between these formats to do different types of summaries or visualisation.

Let's look again at just the `totalprice` data from the untidy table above. We can select just the columns we want using the `dplyr::select()` function. This function's first argument is the data table you want to select from, then each argument after that is either the name of a column in that table, or `new_name = old_name`. This is a useful function for changing the column names and order of columns, as well as selecting a subset of columns.

```{r}
# select just the customer ID and 3 total price columns
untidy_price <- select(
  .data = untidy_data,
  customer_id, 
  `2018` = totalprice_2018,
  `2019` = totalprice_2019,
  `2020` = totalprice_2020
)
```

```{r wide-data, echo = FALSE}
kable(untidy_price, caption = "Wide data")
```

This is in wide format, where each row is a customer, and represents the data from several years. This is a really intuitive way for humans to read a table, but it's not as easy for a computer to process it.

The same data can be represented in a long format by creating a new column that specifies what `item` the observation is from and a new column that specifies the `value` of that observation. This is easier to use to make summaries and plots.

```{r long-data, echo = FALSE}
untidy_price %>%
  gather("year", "totalprice", 2:4) %>%
  kable(caption = "Long data")
```

::: {.try data-latex=""}

Create a long version of the following table. You don't need to use code, just sketch it in a notebook or make a table in a spreadsheet.

| id     | twitter_followers | instagram_followers |
|:-------|:------------------|:--------------------|
| Emily  | 3487              | 120                 |
| Lisa   | 9110              | 110                 |


`r hide("Answer")`
Your answer doesn't need to have the same column headers or be in the same order.

| id     | social_media | followers |
|:-------|:-------------|:----------|
| Emily  | twitter      | 3487      |
| Emily  | instagram    | 120       |
| Lisa   | twitter      | 9110      | 
| Lisa   | instagram    | 110       |

`r unhide()`

:::


The pivot functions allow you to transform a data table from wide to long or long to wide.


#### Wide to long

The function `pivot_longer()` converts a wide data table to a longer format by converting the headers from specified columns into the values of new columns, and combining the values of those columns into a new condensed column.

This function has several arguments:

* `cols`: the columns you want to make long; you can refer to them by their names, like `` c(`2018`, `2019`, `2020`) `` or `` `2018`:`2020` `` or by their numbers, like `c(2, 3, 4)` or `2:4`
* `names_to`: what you want to call the new columns that the `cols` column header names will go into
* `values_to`: what you want to call the new column that contains the values in the `cols` 

```{r pivot-longer}
untidy_price_long <- pivot_longer(
  data = untidy_price, 
  cols = `2018`:`2020`, # columns to make long 
  names_to = "year", # new column name for headers
  values_to = "totalprice" # new column name for values
)
```

`r kable(untidy_price_long, caption = "Data made longer with pivot_longer()")`

#### Long to wide

We can also go from long to wide format using the `pivot_wider()` function.

* `names_from`: the columns that contain your new column headers.
* `values_from`: the column that contains the values for the new columns.
* `names_sep`:the character string used to join names if `names_from` is more than one column.

```{r pivot-wider}
untidy_price_wide <- pivot_wider(
  data = untidy_price_long,
  names_from = year,
  values_from = totalprice
)
```

`r kable(untidy_price_wide, caption = "Data made wider with pivot_wider()")`

## Multi-step tidying

You often need to go from wide, to long, to an intermediate shape in order to get your data into a format that is useful for plotting, where there is a column for each variable that you want to represent with an aesthetic.

Our full `untidy_data` table has seven columns: a customer ID, three columns for `itemsprice` and 3 columns for `totalprice`.

`r untidy_data`

We want to get it into the tidy format where each row is an observation of one customer per year, with the columns of `customer_id`, `year`, `item`, `price_per_item` and `totalprice`.

`r tidy_data`

### One observation per row

The original table has observations from each customer over three years. This is too many observations per row, so first we'll start by making the table long. We need to make 6 rows for each customer, one for each variable-year combo, with columns for the customer ID, year, variable, and value. 

Because we'll be combining columns with numeric and character data type, we need to  make the new `value` column a character data type using `values_transform`, since numbers can be represented as characters (like `r hl("3.5")`), but character strings can't be represented as numbers.

```{r}
longer_data <- pivot_longer(
  data = untidy_data, 
  cols = itemsprice_2018:totalprice_2020, # columns to make long 
  names_to = c("category", "year"),       # new column names for cols
  names_sep = "_",                        # how to split cols into new columns
  # names_pattern = "(.*)_(.*)", # alternative to names_sep
  values_to = "value", # new column name for values
  
  # make sure new columns are the right data type
  names_transform = list(year = as.integer),
  values_transform = list(value = as.character) 
)
```

`r kable(longer_data, caption = "Untidy data converted from wide to long.")`

### One variable per column

Now the `value` column contains data from two different variables. We need to make the table wider, but not as wide as before. We want to keep the `year` column and make new columns called `itemsprice` and `totalprice` with the relevant customer's `value` for that variable and year.

```{r}
wider_data <- pivot_wider(
  data = longer_data,
  id_cols = c(customer_id, year),
  names_from = category,
  values_from = value
)
```

`r kable(wider_data, caption = "Data converted from long to an intermediate shape.")`


### One value per cell

The cells in the `itemsprice` column actually contain two different values. We need to split it into two columns for the variables `items`, and `price_per_item`. You can split a column into parts with the function `tidyr::separate()`. 

```{r}
split_data <- separate(
  data = wider_data, 
  col = itemsprice, # the column to split
  into = c("items", "price_per_item"), # the new columns to create
  sep = " ", # how to split col
  remove = TRUE, # whether to remove to old col
  convert = TRUE # whether to fix the data type of the new columns
)
```

`r kable(split_data, caption = "The itemsprice column split into items and price_per_item using separate()")`

::: {.warning data-latex=""}
If the new columns should have a different `r glossary("data type")` from the old column, set `convert = TRUE` to automatically fix them. This is common when you have columns that contain multiple numbers, separated by commas or semicolons. These are character types before they are separated, but should be numeric types after so that you can do mathematical operations like sum them.
:::


### Altering data

The column `price_per_item` is still a character column because it has parentheses. There are a few ways to fix this. You can use the `dplyr::mutate()` function to change a column or add a new one.

Here, we'll use `stringr::str_replace_all()` to replace all of the "(" and ")" with "".

```{r}
mutated_data <- mutate(
  .data = split_data,
  price_per_item = stringr::str_replace_all(
    string = price_per_item, 
    pattern = "[()]", 
    replacement = ""
  )
)
```

`r kable(mutated_data, caption = "Mutating data to remove the parentheses from price_per_item.")`

### Fixing data types

The `price_per_item` and `totalprice` columns are still characters, so you can't do things like calculate the sum of `totalprice`.

```{r}
# check the data types
glimpse(mutated_data)
```

Once the data are clean and tidy, you can fix all of your column data types in one step using `readr::type_convert()`. This is good practice when you've finished cleaning a data set. If the automatic type detection doesn't work as expected, this usually means that you still have non-numeric characters in a column where there were only supposed to be numbers. You can also manually set the column types in the same way as for `readr::read_csv()`

```{r, message = FALSE}
tidy_data <- type_convert(
  df = mutated_data,
  trim_ws = TRUE, # removes spaces before and after values
)

# check the data types
glimpse(tidy_data)
```


## Pipes {#pipes}

<div style="width: 200px; float: right;"><img src="images/pipe_sticker.png" style="width: 100%" /></div>

Pipes are a way to order your code in a more readable format. 

You can always create a new object at every step and use that object in the next step, like we did above. This is pretty clear, but you've created several unnecessary data objects in your environment. This can get confusing in very long scripts. 

```{r}
untidy_data <- read_csv(file = "data/untidy_data.csv")

longer_data <- pivot_longer(
  data = untidy_data,
  cols = itemsprice_2018:totalprice_2020,
  names_to = c("category", "year"),
  names_sep = "_", 
  values_to = "value", 
  names_transform = list(year = as.integer),
  values_transform = list(value = as.character) 
) 

wider_data <- pivot_wider(
  data = longer_data,
  id_cols = c(customer_id, year),
  names_from = category,
  values_from = value
)

split_data <- separate(
  data = wider_data,
  col = itemsprice,
  into = c("items", "price_per_item"),
  sep = " ", 
  remove = TRUE, 
  convert = TRUE
) 

mutated_data <- mutate(
  .data = split_data,
  price_per_item = stringr::str_replace_all(
    string = price_per_item, 
    pattern = "[()]", 
    replacement = ""
  )
) 

tidy_data <- type_convert(
  df = mutated_data,
  trim_ws = TRUE,
)
```


::: {.warning data-latex=""}
You *can* name each object `data` and keep replacing the old data object with the new one at each step. This will keep your environment clean, but I don't recommend it because it makes it too easy to accidentally run your code out of order when you are running line-by-line for development or debugging.
:::

One way to avoid extra objects is to nest your functions, literally replacing each data object with the code that generated it in the previous step. This can be fine for very short chains.

```{r ok-chain}
mean_total_price <- round(mean(tidy_data$totalprice), 2)
```

But it gets extremely confusing for long chains:

```{r, message = FALSE}
# do not ever do this!!!!!!
tidy_data <- type_convert(
  df = mutate(
    .data = separate(
      data = pivot_wider(
        data = pivot_longer(
          data = read_csv(file = "data/untidy_data.csv"),
          cols = itemsprice_2018:totalprice_2020,
          names_to = c("category", "year"),
          names_sep = "_",
          values_to = "value",
          names_transform = list(year = as.integer),
          values_transform = list(value = as.character)
        ) ,
        id_cols = c(customer_id, year),
        names_from = category,
        values_from = value
      ),
      col = itemsprice,
      into = c("items", "price_per_item"),
      sep = " ",
      remove = TRUE,
      convert = TRUE
    ) ,
    price_per_item = stringr::str_replace_all(
      string = price_per_item,
      pattern = "[()]",
      replacement = ""
    )
  ),
  trim_ws = TRUE,
)
```


The pipe lets you "pipe" the result of each function into the next function, allowing you to put your code in a logical order without creating too many extra objects. By default, the result of the previous function becomes the first `r glossary("argument")` to the next function. Most tidyverse functions take a data table as their first argument, so they pipe together easily.

For example, instead of making a table called `untidy_data` by reading a csv file, and then making a new table called `totalprice_data` by selecting the `customer_id` and `totalprice_{year}` columns from `untidy_data`...

```{r, message = FALSE}
untidy_data <- read_csv(file = "data/untidy_data.csv")

totalprice_data <- select(
  .data = untidy_data,
  customer_id, 
  starts_with("totalprice") # selects all columns that start with a string
)
```

... you can just make one table called `totalprice_data` by reading the csv file and **piping** the resulting table into the `select()` function.  

```{r}
totalprice_data <- read_csv(file = "data/untidy_data.csv") %>%
  select(
    customer_id, 
    starts_with("totalprice") 
  )
```

::: {.info data-latex=""}
Notice how we no longer need to specify the `.data` argument. Add it back in and see what happens. This is a common error when you're converting code from using separate variables to using a pipeline, but you'll learn to identify it quickly.
:::

For longer series of steps like the one above, using pipes can eliminate many intermediate objects. This also makes it easier to add an intermediate step to your process without having to think of a new table name and edit the table input to the next step.


```{r, message = FALSE}
tidy_data <- read_csv(file = "data/untidy_data.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = itemsprice_2018:totalprice_2020,
    names_to = c("category", "year"),
    names_sep = "_", 
    values_to = "value", 
    names_transform = list(year = as.integer),
    values_transform = list(value = as.character) 
  ) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = c(customer_id, year),
    names_from = category,
    values_from = value
  ) %>%
  separate(
    col = itemsprice,
    into = c("items", "price_per_item"),
    sep = " ", 
    remove = TRUE, 
    convert = TRUE
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    price_per_item = stringr::str_replace_all(
      string = price_per_item, 
      pattern = "[()]", 
      replacement = ""
    )
  ) %>%
  type_convert(
    trim_ws = TRUE,
  )
```

You can read the code above like this:

1. Read the data (`read_csv()`)
    * `file`: from the file at r path("data/untidy_data.csv")`; **and then**
2. Reshape the data longer (`pivot_longer()`)
    * `cols`: take the columns from `itemsprice_2018` to `totalprice_2020`,
    * `names_to`: create new columns called "category" and "year" from the `cols` header names,
    * `names_sep`: separate the column names using "_"
    * `values_to`: create a new column called "value" from the `cols` values, 
    * `names_transform` = transform the `year` column to integers,
    * `values_transform` = transform the `value` column to characters; **and then**
3. Reshape the data wider (`pivot_wider()`)
    * `id_cols`: each row should be an observation of a unique `customer_id` and `year`,
    * `names_from`: get the new column names from the values in the `category` column,
    * `values_from`: get the new column values from the values in the `value` column; **and then**
4. Split multiple values in the same column (`separate()`)
    * `col`: separate the column `itemsprice`,
    * `into`: into new columns called "items" and "price_per_item",
    * `sep`: separate the values at each " ", 
    * `remove`: do remove the old column, 
    * `convert`: do convert the new columns into the right data types; **and then**
5. Change a column (`mutate()`)
    * `price_per_item`: replace the existing column `price_per_item` with the result of a search and replace:
        * `string`: the strings to modify come from the `price_per_item` columns, 
        * `pattern`: search for left or right parentheses, 
        * `replacement`: replace them with ""; **and then**,
6. Fix data types (`type_convert()`)
    * `trim_ws`: remove spaces, tabs, and line breaks from the start and end of each value


Don't feel like you always need to get all of your data wrangling code into a single pipeline. You should make intermediate objects whenever you need to break up your code because it's getting too complicated or if you need to debug something.

::: {.info data-latex=""}
You can debug a pipe by highlighting from the beginning to just before the pipe you want to stop at. Try this by highlighting from `data <-` to the end of the `separate` function and typing cmd-return. What does `data` look like now?

## Exercises {#exercises-tidy}

Let's say you have a [small Excel table](data/widgets_gadgets.xlsx) with 10 customer IDs, and how many widgets and gadgets each purchased in 2020 and 2021. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(90210)
data_original <- tibble(
  customer_id = 1:10,
  widgets_2020 = sample(0:6, 10, T),
  widgets_2021 = sample(0:6, 10, T),
  gadgets_2020 = sample(0:6, 10, T),
  gadgets_2021 = sample(0:6, 10, T)
)

kable(data_original, col.names = c("Customer ID", "2020", "2021", "2020", "2021")) %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Widgets" = 2, "Gadgets" = 2))
```

You want to calculate the total number of items purchased per year to make a table sorted by the total number of items purchased.

### Load the data

The data file  ([`r path("widgets_gadgets.xlsx")`](data/widgets_gadgets.xlsx)) has multiple header columns, so you'll need to skip some rows when you import the data and set your own column names: `customer_id`, `widgets_2020`,`widgets_2021`, gadgets_2020` and `gadgets_2021`.

```{r, webex.hide="Solution"}
# get the data with better column names
data_original <- readxl::read_excel(
  path = "data/widgets_gadgets.xlsx",
  skip = 2,
  col_names = c(
    "customer_id",
    "widgets_2020",
    "widgets_2021",
    "gadgets_2020",
    "gadgets_2021"
  )
)
```

### Reshape the data longer

These data are in wide format, with a customer's number of widgets and gadgets across two years in the same row. Convert the data shape so that each row is one customer's order for one item type for one year. This table should have 40 rows for the combination of 10 customers times 2 item types times 2 years, and 4 columns: `custmer_id`, `item`, `year`, and `number`.

```{r, webex.hide="Solution"}
data_longer <- pivot_longer(
  data = data_original,
  cols = 2:5,
  names_to = c("item", "year"),
  names_sep = "_",
  values_to = "number"
)
```


### Reshape the data wider

Convert the data shape so that each row is one customer's order of widgets and gadgets for one year. This table should have 20 rows for the combination of 10 customers times 2 years, and 4 columns: `custmer_id`, `year`, `widgets` and `gadgets`.

```{r, webex.hide="Solution"}
data_wider <- pivot_wider(
  data = data_longer,
  id_cols = c(customer_id, year),
  names_from = item,
  values_from = number
)
```


### Rename and reorder

Change the order of columns and their names so that the column headers are `Year`, Customer ID`, `Gadgets`, and `Widgets` .

```{r, webex.hide="Solution"}
# column names with special characters have to be inside backticks
# you can put all column names inside backticks if you want
data <- select(
  .data = data_wider,
  Year = year,
  `Customer ID` = customer_id,
  Gadgets = gadgets,
  Widgets = widgets
)
```

### Put in a pipeline

Put the four steps above into a single pipeline. Practice reading the code from top to bottom.
