# Data Tidying {#tidy}

<div class="incomplete-chapter"></div>

## Intended Learning Outcomes {#ilo-tidy}

-   Be able to reshape data between long and wide formats
-   Separate, change, reorder, and rename columns
-   Use pipes to chain together functions

In this chapter we'll use the following packages:

```{r setup-tidy, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # for data wrangling
```

## Set-up

First, create a new project for the work we'll do in this chapter named `r path("07-tidy")`. Second, open and save and new R Markdown document named `tidy`.Rmd\`, delete the welcome text and load the required packages for this chapter.

## Data Structures

The data you work with will likely come in many different formats and structures. Some of these structures may be driven by how the software you use outputs the data, but data structures may also differ because of human intervention or attempts at organisation, some of which may not be particularly helpful.

Data cleaning and tidying will likely be the most time consuming and difficult task you perform. Whilst you can create code recipes for analyses and visualisations, as Hadley Whickham puts it ["every messy dataset is messy in its own way"](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) which means that you will often have to solve new problems that are specific to the dataset. Additionally, moving between data structures that are intuitive to read by humans and those that are useful for a computer requires a conceptual shift that only comes with practice. This is all a verbose way of saying that what lies ahead in this chapter is unlikely to sink in on the first attempt and you will need to practice with different examples (preferably with data you know well) before you truly feel comfortable with it.

First, some terminology.

An `r glossary("observation")` is all the information about a single "thing" at a single point in time. These things can be customers, sales, orders, feedback questionnaires, tweets, or really anything. Observations should have a way to identify them, such as a unique ID or combination of variable values.

A `r glossary("variable")` is one type of information about the observation. For example, if the observation is a sale, the variables you might have about the sale are the sale ID, the customer's ID, the date of the sale, the price paid, and method of payment.

A `r glossary("value")` is the data for one variable for one observation. For example, the value of the date variable from the observation of a sale might be `2021-08-20`.

The following table is data from an experiment where participants' reactions times are tested on two separate occasions.

| Participant | RT - test 1 | RT - test 2 | RT - test 3 |
|-------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 1           | 356                    | 850                    | 400                    |

| 3           | 471                    | 668                    | 522                    |
| 4           | 510                    | 1020                   | 850                    |

-   What is `356`? `r mcq(c(x = "Observation", x = "Variable", answer = "Value"))`
-   What is test time? `r mcq(c(x = "Observation", answer = "Variable", x = "Value"))`
-   How many variables are there in this dataset? `r fitb(3)`

`r hide("Explain these answers")`

-   There are three variables, Participant, Reaction time, and test time. Even though test time is spread out across three columns, it is still one variable.
-   `356` is a value because it is a single data point for one variable for one observation.

```{r, include=FALSE}
set.seed(90210)

tidy_data <- crossing(
  customer_id = 1:5,
  year = 2018:2020
) %>%
  mutate(items = sample(0:10, nrow(.), T)) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(price_per_item = round(rnorm(1, 5, 2), 2)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(totalprice = items * price_per_item)

untidy_data <- tidy_data %>%
  mutate(itemsprice = glue::glue("{items} ({price_per_item})")) %>%
  select(-items, -price_per_item) %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = customer_id,
              names_from = year,
              values_from = c(itemsprice, totalprice)
              )

write_csv(tidy_data, "data/tidy_data.csv")
write_csv(untidy_data, "data/untidy_data.csv")

```

### Untidy data

First, let's have a look at an example of a messy, or untidy, dataset. Each row has all of the data relating to one customer.

* The `itemsprice_{year}` columns contain two values (number of items and price per item)
* The `totalprice_{year}` columns contain the total amount spent by that customer that year, i.e., item * price.
* There is data for three different years in the dataset.

`r kable(untidy_data, caption = "Untidy table")`

Let's say you wanted to calculate the total price per customer over the three years and the total number of items bought per customer. You can't perform mathematical operations on the `itemsprice_{year}` columns because they are `r glossary("character")` `r glossary("data type", "data types")`.

You would probably normally use Excel to

1.  split `itemsprice_2018` column into `item_2018` and `price_2018` columns
2.  split `itemsprice_2019` column into `item_2019` and `price_2019` columns
3.  split `itemsprice_2020` column into `item_2018` and `price_2020` columns
4.  add `item_2018 + item_2019 + item_2020` to get the total number of items bought per customer
5.  add `totalprice_2018 + totalprice_2019 + totalprice_2020` to get the total price per customer

::: {.try data-latex=""}
Think about how many steps in Excel this would be if there were 10 years in the table, or a different number of years each time you encountered data like this.
:::

### Tidy data

There are three rules for "tidy data", which is data in a format that makes it easier to combine data from different tables, create summary tables, and visualise your data.

-   Each observation must have its own row
-   Each variable must have its own column
-   Each value must have its own cell

This is the tidy version:

* There are now five variables (columns) because there are five different types of information we have on each customer, their id, the year, number of items bought, price per item, and total price. Even though there's multiple values in each one, these values all correspond to just five different types of information.
* Each row is a customer's orders in a particular year. 
* The number of items (`items`) and price per item (`price_per_item`) are in separate columns, so now you can perform mathematical operations on them.

`r kable(tidy_data, caption = "Tidy table")`

To calculate the total price per customer over the three years and the total number of items bought per customer in R, you could then:

1.  group the table by customer_id
2.  sum the `items` column to get the total number of items bought per customer
3.  sum the `totalprice` column to get the total price per customer

```{r, message=FALSE}
tidy_data <- read_csv("data/tidy_data.csv")

tidy_data %>%
  group_by(customer_id) %>%
  summarise(
    total_items = sum(items),
    total_price = sum(totalprice)
  )
```

It also makes it very easier to use with `ggplot()` - try running each of the following plots. 

```{r eval = FALSE}

# all years
ggplot(tidy_data, aes(x = totalprice)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, colour = "black")

# different fill on one plot for each year
ggplot(tidy_data, aes(x = totalprice, fill = as.factor(year))) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, colour = "black")

ggplot(tidy_data, aes(x = totalprice, fill = as.factor(year))) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, 
                 colour = "black",
                 show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~year)
```


::: {.info data-latex=""}
If there were 10 years in the table, or a different number of years each time you encountered data like this, the code for producing the tables and plots above never changes.
:::

If you have control over how the data are recorded, it will make your life easier to record it in a tidy format from the start. However, we don't always have control, so this class will also teach you how to convert untidy tables into tidy tables.

## Reshaping Data

Data tables can be in `r glossary("wide")` format or `r glossary("long")` format (or a mix of the two). Wide data are where all of the observations about one thing are in the same row, while long data are where each observation is on a separate row. You often need to convert between these formats to do different types of summaries or visualisation. You may have done something similar using pivot tables in Excel.

```{r img-pivot-table, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Converting between wide and long formats using pivot tables in Excel."}

knitr::include_graphics("images/tidy/excel_pivot_table.png")

```

It can be easier to just consider one type of measurement at a time. `untidy_data` has two types of measurements, total price and price per time. Let's look at just the `totalprice` data first. 

We can select just the columns we want using the `dplyr::select()` function. This function's first argument is the data table you want to select from, then each argument after that is either the name of a column in that table, or `new_name = old_name`. This is a useful function for changing the column names and order of columns, as well as selecting a subset of columns. Note that because the names of the columns are numbers, they need to be wrapped in backticks otherwise it won't work.

```{r}
# select just the customer ID and 3 total price columns
untidy_price <- select(
  .data = untidy_data,
  customer_id, 
  `2018` = totalprice_2018,
  `2019` = totalprice_2019,
  `2020` = totalprice_2020
)
```

```{r wide-data, echo = FALSE}
kable(untidy_price, caption = "Wide data")
```

This is in wide format, where each row is a customer, and represents the data from several years. This is a really intuitive way for humans to read a table, but it's not as easy for a computer to process it.

The same data can be represented in a long format by creating a new column that specifies what `year` the observation is from and a new column that specifies the `totalprice` of that observation. This is easier to use to make summaries and plots.

```{r long-data, echo = FALSE}
untidy_price %>%
  gather("year", "totalprice", 2:4) %>%
  kable(caption = "Long data")
```

The pivot functions allow you to transform a data table from wide to long or long to wide.

#### Wide to long

The function `pivot_longer()` converts a wide data table to a longer format by converting the headers from specified columns into the values of new columns, and combining the values of those columns into a new condensed column.

This function has several arguments:

-   `cols`: the columns you want to make long; you can refer to them by their names, like `` c(`2018`, `2019`, `2020`) `` or `` `2018`:`2020` `` or by their numbers, like `c(2, 3, 4)` or `2:4`
-   `names_to`: what you want to call the new columns that the `cols` column header names will go into
-   `values_to`: what you want to call the new column that contains the values in the `cols`

With the pivot functions, it can be easier to show than tell - run the below code and then compare `untidy_price` with `untidy_price_long` and the pivot code and try to map each argument to what has changed. 

```{r pivot-longer}
untidy_price_long <- pivot_longer(
  data = untidy_price, 
  cols = `2018`:`2020`, # columns to make long 
  names_to = "year", # new column name for headers
  values_to = "totalprice" # new column name for values
)
```

`r kable(untidy_price_long, caption = "Data made longer with pivot_longer()")`

#### Long to wide

We can also go from long to wide format using the `pivot_wider()` function.

-   `names_from`: the columns that contain your new column headers.
-   `values_from`: the column that contains the values for the new columns.
-   `names_sep`:the character string used to join names if `names_from` is more than one column.

```{r pivot-wider}
untidy_price_wide <- pivot_wider(
  data = untidy_price_long,
  names_from = year,
  values_from = totalprice
)
```

`r kable(untidy_price_wide, caption = "Data made wider with pivot_wider()")`

## Multi-step tidying {#multistep}

You often need to go from wide, to long, to an intermediate shape in order to get your data into a format that is useful for plotting, where there is a column for each variable that you want to represent with an aesthetic.

Our full `untidy_data` table has seven columns: a customer ID, three columns for `itemsprice` and 3 columns for `totalprice`.

`r untidy_data`

We want to get it into the tidy format below where each row is an observation of one customer per year, with the columns of `customer_id`, `year`, `item`, `price_per_item` and `totalprice`. Before trying to reshape any dataset, you should be able to visualise what it will look like. Sketching out your tables on a piece of paper can really help make these transformations make sense.

`r tidy_data`

### One observation per row

The original table has observations from each customer over three years. This is too many observations per row, so first we'll start by making the table long. We need to make 6 rows for each customer, one for each category (item price/total price) and year combination, with columns for the customer ID, year, category, and value.

Because we'll be combining columns with numeric (`totalprice`) and character (`itemsprice`) data, we need to make the new `value` column a character data type using `values_transform`, since numbers can be represented as characters (like `r hl("3.5")`), but character strings can't be represented as numbers.

```{r}
longer_data <- pivot_longer(
  data = untidy_data, 
  cols = itemsprice_2018:totalprice_2020, # columns to make long 
  names_to = c("category", "year"),       # new column names for cols
  names_sep = "_",                        # how to split cols into new columns
  # names_pattern = "(.*)_(.*)", # alternative to names_sep
  values_to = "value", # new column name for values
  
  # make sure new columns are the right data type
  names_transform = list(year = as.integer),
  values_transform = list(value = as.character) 
)
```

`r kable(longer_data, caption = "Untidy data converted from wide to long.")`

### One variable per column

Now the `value` column contains data from two different variables. We need to make the table wider, but not as wide as before. We want to keep the `year` column and make new columns called `itemsprice` and `totalprice` with the relevant customer's `value` for that variable and year.

```{r}
wider_data <- pivot_wider(
  data = longer_data,
  id_cols = c(customer_id, year),
  names_from = category,
  values_from = value
)
```

`r kable(wider_data, caption = "Data converted from long to an intermediate shape.")`

### One value per cell

The cells in the `itemsprice` column actually contain two different values. We need to split it into two columns for the variables `items`, and `price_per_item`. You can split a column into parts with the function `tidyr::separate()`. There is a space between the number of items and the brackets, so we can split it along this space - if you are in charge of how data is stored, ensuring data is entered consistently makes this much easier.

```{r}
split_data <- separate(
  data = wider_data, 
  col = itemsprice, # the column to split
  into = c("items", "price_per_item"), # the new columns to create
  sep = " ", # split col by space
  remove = TRUE, # whether to remove to old col
  convert = TRUE # whether to fix the data type of the new columns
)
```

`r kable(split_data, caption = "The itemsprice column split into items and price_per_item using separate()")`

::: {.warning data-latex=""}
If the new columns should have a different `r glossary("data type")` from the old column, set `convert = TRUE` to automatically fix them. This is common when you have columns that contain multiple numbers, separated by commas or semicolons. These are character types before they are separated, but should be numeric types after so that you can do mathematical operations like sum them.
:::

### Altering data

The column `price_per_item` is still a character column because it has parentheses. There are a few ways to fix this. You can use the `dplyr::mutate()` function to change a column or add a new one.

Here, we'll use `stringr::str_replace_all()` to replace all of the "(" and ")" with "".

```{r}
mutated_data <- mutate(
  .data = split_data,
  price_per_item = stringr::str_replace_all(
    string = price_per_item, 
    pattern = "[()]", 
    replacement = ""
  )
)
```

`r kable(mutated_data, caption = "Mutating data to remove the parentheses from price_per_item.")`

### Fixing data types

The `price_per_item` and `totalprice` columns are still characters, so you can't do things like calculate the sum of `totalprice`.

```{r}
# check the data types
glimpse(mutated_data)
```

Once the data are clean and tidy, you can fix all of your column data types in one step using `readr::type_convert()`. This is good practice when you've finished cleaning a data set. If the automatic type detection doesn't work as expected, this usually means that you still have non-numeric characters in a column where there were only supposed to be numbers. You can also manually set the column types in the same way as for `readr::read_csv()` (see Chapter \@ref(data)).

```{r, message = FALSE}
tidy_data <- type_convert(
  df = mutated_data,
  trim_ws = TRUE # removes spaces before and after values
)

# check the data types
glimpse(tidy_data)
```

## Pipes {#pipes}

::: {style="width: 200px; float: right;"}
<img src="images/tidy/pipe_sticker.png" style="width: 100%"/>
:::

We've already introduced pipes in Chapter\ \@ref(pipes-first) but this type of data processing is where they really start to shine as they can reduce the amount of code you write significantly. 

As a recap, a pipe takes the result of the previous function and sends it to the next function as its first argument, which means that you do not need to create intermediate objects. Below is all the code we've used in this chapter, and in the process we created five objects. This can get very confusing in longer scripts.

```{r, message = FALSE}
untidy_data <- read_csv(file = "data/untidy_data.csv")

longer_data <- pivot_longer(
  data = untidy_data,
  cols = itemsprice_2018:totalprice_2020,
  names_to = c("category", "year"),
  names_sep = "_", 
  values_to = "value", 
  names_transform = list(year = as.integer),
  values_transform = list(value = as.character) 
) 

wider_data <- pivot_wider(
  data = longer_data,
  id_cols = c(customer_id, year),
  names_from = category,
  values_from = value
)

split_data <- separate(
  data = wider_data,
  col = itemsprice,
  into = c("items", "price_per_item"),
  sep = " ", 
  remove = TRUE, 
  convert = TRUE
) 

mutated_data <- mutate(
  .data = split_data,
  price_per_item = stringr::str_replace_all(
    string = price_per_item, 
    pattern = "[()]", 
    replacement = ""
  )
) 

tidy_data <- type_convert(
  df = mutated_data,
  trim_ws = TRUE
)
```

::: {.warning data-latex=""}
You *can* give each object the same name and keep replacing the old data object with the new one at each step. This will keep your environment clean, but it makes debugging code much harder.
:::

For longer series of steps like the one above, using pipes can eliminate many intermediate objects. This also makes it easier to add an intermediate step to your process without having to think of a new table name and edit the table input to the next step.

```{r, message = FALSE}
tidy_data <- read_csv(file = "data/untidy_data.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = itemsprice_2018:totalprice_2020,
    names_to = c("category", "year"),
    names_sep = "_", 
    values_to = "value", 
    names_transform = list(year = as.integer),
    values_transform = list(value = as.character) 
  ) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = c(customer_id, year),
    names_from = category,
    values_from = value
  ) %>%
  separate(
    col = itemsprice,
    into = c("items", "price_per_item"),
    sep = " ", 
    remove = TRUE, 
    convert = TRUE
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    price_per_item = stringr::str_replace_all(
      string = price_per_item, 
      pattern = "[()]", 
      replacement = ""
    )
  ) %>%
  type_convert(
    trim_ws = TRUE
  )
```

You can read the code above like this:

1.  Read the data (`read_csv()`)

    -   `file`: from the file at r path("data/untidy_data.csv")\`; **and then**

2.  Reshape the data longer (`pivot_longer()`)

    -   `cols`: take the columns from `itemsprice_2018` to `totalprice_2020`,
    -   `names_to`: create new columns called "category" and "year" from the `cols` header names,
    -   `names_sep`: separate the column names using "\_"
    -   `values_to`: create a new column called "value" from the `cols` values,
    -   `names_transform` = transform the `year` column to integers,
    -   `values_transform` = transform the `value` column to characters; **and then**

3.  Reshape the data wider (`pivot_wider()`)

    -   `id_cols`: each row should be an observation of a unique `customer_id` and `year`,
    -   `names_from`: get the new column names from the values in the `category` column,
    -   `values_from`: get the new column values from the values in the `value` column; **and then**

4.  Split multiple values in the same column (`separate()`)

    -   `col`: separate the column `itemsprice`,
    -   `into`: into new columns called "items" and "price_per_item",
    -   `sep`: separate the values at each " ",
    -   `remove`: do remove the old column,
    -   `convert`: do convert the new columns into the right data types; **and then**

5.  Change a column (`mutate()`)

    -   `price_per_item`: replace the existing column `price_per_item` with the result of a search and replace:

        -   `string`: the strings to modify come from the `price_per_item` columns,
        -   `pattern`: search for left or right parentheses,
        -   `replacement`: replace them with ""; **and then**,

6.  Fix data types (`type_convert()`)

    -   `trim_ws`: remove spaces, tabs, and line breaks from the start and end of each value

Don't feel like you always need to get all of your data wrangling code into a single pipeline. You should make intermediate objects whenever you need to break up your code because it's getting too complicated or if you need to debug something.

::: {.info data-latex=""}
You can debug a pipe by highlighting from the beginning to just before the pipe you want to stop at. Try this by highlighting from `data <-` to the end of the `separate` function and typing cmd-return. What does `data` look like now?
