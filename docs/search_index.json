The book will introduce learners to R, a programming language that can help automate working with data. The book will cover importing and processing data from spreadsheets, producing data summaries of descriptive statistics in tables, creating beautiful and informative visualisations, and constructing reports, presentations, and dashboards that automatically update when the underlying data changes. By the end of this book, you will be able to: Use R to clean and process data. Use R to summarise data. Use R to informatively visualise data. Use R to create reusable report templates.

The sections below explain how and there is a helpful YouTube video here. A.1 Installing Base R Install base R from https://cran.rstudio.com/. Choose the download link for your operating system (Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows). If you have a Mac, install the latest release from the newest R-x.x.x.pkg link (or a legacy version if you have an older operating system). After you install R, you should also install XQuartz to be able to use some visualisation packages. If you are installing the Windows version, choose the \"base\" subdirectory and click on the download link at the top of the page. After you install R, you should also install RTools; use the \"recommended\" version highlighted near the top of the list. If you are using Linux, choose your specific operating system and follow the installation instructions. A.2 Installing RStudio Go to rstudio.com and download the RStudio Desktop (Open Source License) version for your operating system under the list titled Installers for Supported Platforms. A.2.1 RStudio Settings There are a few settings you should fix immediately after updating RStudio. Go to Global Options... under the Tools menu (âŒ˜,), and in the General tab, uncheck the box that says Restore .RData into workspace at startup. If you keep things around in your workspace, things will get messy, and unexpected things will happen. You should always start with a clear workspace. This also means that you never want to save your workspace when you exit, so set this to Never. The only thing you want to save are your scripts. You may also want to change the appearance of your code. Different fonts and themes can sometimes help with visual difficulties or [dyslexia]((https://datacarpentry.org/blog/2017/09/coding-and-dyslexia){target=\"_blank\"}. I prefer a dark background and the FiraCode font for my own coding, but I will use the default theme for screenshots in this book. Figure A.1: My RStudio General and Appearance settings Figure A.2: My RStudio General and Appearance settings You may also want to change the settings in the Code tab. I prefer two spaces instead of tabs for my code and I like to be able to see the whitespace characters. But these are all a matter of personal preference. Figure A.3: My RStudio Code settings Figure A.4: My RStudio Code settings A.3 Installing LaTeX You can install the LaTeX typesetting system to produce PDF reports from RStudio. Without this additional installation, you will be able to produce reports in HTML but not PDF. This course will not require you to make PDFs. To generate PDF reports, you will additionally need: pandoc, and LaTeX, a typesetting language, available for WINDOWS: MikTeX Mac OS: MacTex (3.2GB download) or BasicTeX (78MB download, but should work fine) Linux: TeX Live "],["symbols.html", "B Symbols", " B Symbols Symbol psyTeachR Term Also Known As () (round) brackets parentheses [] square brackets brackets {} curly brackets squiggly brackets &lt;&gt; chevrons angled brackets / guillemets &lt; less than &gt; greater than &amp; ampersand \"and\" symbol # hash pound / octothorpe / slash forward slash \\ backslash - dash hyphen / minus _ underscore * asterisk star ^ caret power symbol ~ tilde twiddle / squiggle = equal sign == double equal sign . full stop period / point ! exclamation mark bang / not ? question mark ' single quote quote / apostrophe \" double quote quote %&gt;% pipe magrittr pipe | vertical bar pipe , comma ; semi-colon : colon @ \"at\" symbol various hilarious regional terms ... glossary(\"ellipsis\") dots Figure B.1: Image by James Chapman/Soundimals "],["glossary.html", "C Glossary", " C Glossary See the psyTeachR Glossary for more definitions of R jargon. || || || || "]]
